# ALX Backend Python Project

## Overview

This project is a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various aspects of asynchronous programming using asyncio in Python. It covers basic asynchronous syntax, concurrent coroutines, and tasks.

## Files

- `0x02-python_async_comprehension`: Demonstrates asynchronous comprehension in Python.
  
- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Introduces basic asynchronous syntax and concepts.
  
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Script to measure the runtime of asynchronous functions.
  
- `3-tasks.py`: Includes examples of using asyncio tasks.
  
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Demonstrates concurrent execution of coroutines using asyncio.
  
- `4-tasks.py`: More examples of asyncio tasks and their usage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- asyncio library
